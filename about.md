# About me

### Hello and welcome,

  My name is Arnab Ghosh, a mechanical engineer by education and a technical writer by profession. I would not say, I chose technical writing because of a huge passion for writing, but this is something that I was offered and I chose it without any hesitation. Eventually, I realized that I quite enjoyed being in the end-user perspective of every product, also I was helping every user of any product to use the product. Imagine, you are given a machine without any instructions on how to use it, or very basic, what it actually does. Does not sound good, right? I am helping companies deliver a complete product. I liked that. 

 Let me give you a brief about my professional journey.

I started my career on a mechanical production floor, there I would ensure the quality of the jobs produced on the line. Although this was a short stint of two months, I still take pride in mentioning this in my career, because every job has taught me some good lessons and it helped me grow not only in the career, but also as a person.

Then I started working as a Design Engineer on CAD products. Here, I would design special purpose machine (SPM) on SolidWorks. This was a half year journey.   

The next job was my breakthrough in the writing career. I started working as a Courseware Developer, or Instructional Designer, and I was writing courses on CAD products that I was earlier using as a Design Engineer. Initially, I would use the SME approach to build the courses, and try to make the courses more technically sound and accurate. Eventually, I realized that if the technical content is not properly put together, then it would make no sense to its readers. This is when I educated myself on instructional design philosophies like ADDIE, and Gagne's 9 events. 
While I was developing courses, we followed a style guide for writing. Earlier, it made no sense to me. The question of being monotonous always struck me, as to why do we repeat the same structure of a sentence, does the reader not get bored by reading the same type of sentence again and again. Later, with experience it became clear to me that the reader is not reading the content for fun or as a hobby, but to learn something. Maintaining the same sentence structure will help the readers to grasp the ideas at a faster pace. This is where I started following the intricacies of writing. I would ask our editor the reason for the comments on my written topics. And, it later became clear that I would like to move as a full-time technical writer.

In my next job, I started off as a Lead of Trainings and Tools and by the end of 3rd year in this company I was leading a team of writer that has one tech writer and one translator. So, the story goes in this manner, I was recruited as a course writing expert who would elevate the training methods running in the company and also write some good quality courses.

Sounds like a good plan, doesn't it?

But like Barney Stinson says,"You wanna make God laugh, tell him your plans, right?"

And it came down after the lead technical writer quit the company. I was just 2 months old in the company and someone who knew some amount of writing. I was offered (PS: asked to take up) the role and I took it up without a second thought and never looked back. Since then tech writing became my full job and I was rolling on a roller coaster. In the beginning, it felt quite different from that of the old Instructional Design approach, but later I got used to delivering information more than concentrating on how the information is delivered, as here everything in written format. But, a mixed approach for writing instructions has always helped me deliver a better content, and that is probably the reason why more and more help sites are coming up with intro videos and infographics for a better was of putting the idea.

So, this is a gist of how my experience sounds, thank you for giving your valuable time to read it. If you just scraped through, no worries you have not missed anything, just click the links to in the table of contents (TOC).

### My objective, or goal

Ineffective communication has always been a sore to my eyes, and I cannot stand it. In all the projects that I have done, my objective has been to put myself in the user's shoe and try to perform the tasks that I am writing. If I succeed in completing a task then I am doing a good job, otherwise the topic needs to be relooked.

With my technical writing skills, my goal has been to create an easy-to-understand content with enough information to give confidence to its users on using a product.
