### ***About the Organization***

3DPLM was a subsidiary of Dassault Systemmes, France until it was completely taken over by Dassault in the year 2017. Dassault Systemmes is the world's leading CAD and PLM software organization, which is a sister concern of Dassault Aviation, which manufactures airplanes like Rafale and Mirage.

The Dassault center in Pune, India, where I worked, is an R&D center. As an R&D center, it housed several teams like dev, QA, support, and tech-writing. I was part of the Learning Solutions team.
