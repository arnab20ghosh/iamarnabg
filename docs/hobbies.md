### **Music**

I am a huge metal and hard rock fan, with some inclination towards classic rock and blues.

I am a guitarist, and have played on stage several time at many occasions. I play and acoustic guitar and like to cover Hindi and English, rock and country songs.

Apart from the playing I also have a hobby of collecting music hard copies.

My collection includes albums from some Indian musicians to some international artists like Metallica, Tool, Eluveitie, etc.  

### **Sports**

I love playing table-tennis. I have represented my college in many inter-collegiate tournaments.

### **Automobiles**

I am an automobile enthusiast who likes to stay updated with the automotive market, majorly of India.

Whenever I find time, I like to take up odd car and motorcycle repair jobs.

I wish to fabricate a chopper motorcycle entirely by myself someday.
