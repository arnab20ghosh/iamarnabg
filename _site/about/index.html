Eventually, I realized that I quite enjoyed being in the end-user perspective of every product, guiding the users on how to use them, and being the bridge between the users and the products.</p> <p>Let me give you a brief history of my professional journey.</p> <p>I started my career on a mechanical production floor, there I would ensure the quality of the jobs produced on the line. Although this was a short stint of two months, I still take pride in mentioning this in my career, because every job has taught me some good lessons and it helped me grow not only in my career, but also as a person.</p> <p>Then I started working as a Mechanical Design Engineer and used CAD products on my job. Here, I would design special purpose machine (SPM) on SolidWorks. This was a half year journey.</p> <p>The next job was my breakthrough in the writing career. I started working as a Courseware Developer, or Instructional Designer, and I was writing courses on CAD products that I was earlier using as a Design Engineer. Initially, I would use the SME approach to build the courses, and try to make the courses more technically sound and accurate. Eventually, I realized that if the technical content is not properly put together, it would make no sense to its readers. This is when I educated myself on instructional design philosophies like ADDIE, and Gagne’s 9 events.</p> <p>While I was developing courses, we followed a style guide for writing. Earlier, it made no sense to me. The question of being monotonous always struck me, as to why we repeat the same structure of a sentence, does the reader not get bored by reading the same type of sentence again and again. Later, with experience it became clear to me that the reader is not reading the content for fun or as a hobby, but to learn something. Maintaining the same sentence structure will help the readers to grasp the ideas at a faster pace. This is where I started following the intricacies of writing. I would ask our editor the reason for the comments on my written topics. As the time passed, it became clear to me that I would like to purse my career as a full-time technical writer.</p> <p>In my next job, I started off as a Lead of Trainings and Tools, and by the end of 3rd year in this company I was leading a team of writer that has one tech writer and one translator. So, the story goes in this manner, I was recruited as a course writing expert who would elevate the training methods running in the company and also write some good quality courses.</p> <p>Sounds like a good plan, doesn’t it?</p> <p>But like Barney Stinson says, “You wanna make God laugh, tell him your plans, right?”</p> <p>And all plans were shattered after our lead technical writer quit the company. I was just 2 months old in the company and someone who knew some amount of writing. I was offered (PS: asked to take up) the role of the Lead Technical Writer. I took it up without a second thought and never looked back. Since then tech writing became my full-time job, and it has been a roller-coaster ride ever since. In the beginning, it felt quite different from the Instructional Design approach, but later I concentrated on delivering information, than concentrating on the format of the information. But, a mixed approach for writing instructions has always helped me deliver a better content. That is probably the reason why more and more help sites are moving towards a mixed approach of videos and infographics for a better way of putting the idea.</p> <p>So, this is a gist of how my experience sounds, thank you for giving your valuable time to read it.

In all the projects that I have done, my objective has been to put myself in the user’s shoe and try to perform the tasks that I am writing. If I succeed in completing a task then I am doing a good job, otherwise the topic needs to be relooked.</p> <p>With my technical writing skills, my goal has been to create an easy-to-understand content with enough information to give confidence to its users on using a product.</p> <! > </div> </div> </div> </div> </body> </html>
